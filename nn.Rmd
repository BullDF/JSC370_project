Similar to Gaussian NB, before model fitting I hypothesized that neural network would outperform other models in the classification of music genres. Through several hidden layers, neural network can learn complex, non-linear patterns behind the data. In this project, I experimented with two neural networks with the same architecture, but one with dropout in every layer and one without. From the model performance table, we noticed that the NN without dropout was overfitting to the training set, while the NN with dropout was more generalizable to the test set, which was expected. The test accuracy for both NNs was not high though. More experiments with the architecture and hyperparameter choices can be explored to build a better neural network in the future.
